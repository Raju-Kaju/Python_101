## Opening Hook (5 minutes)

**Teacher:** Good morning everyone! Before we start, I want you to think about this: How many times did you interact with a computer program today before walking into this classroom?

*[Wait for responses - expect answers like: alarm clock, phone, checking social media, etc.]*

**Teacher:** Excellent! Sarah mentioned her phone alarm, Mike talked about checking Instagram, and Elena mentioned the smart board turning on. Here's the amazing thing - every single one of those interactions happened because someone, somewhere, wrote instructions for a computer to follow. Those instructions are called **code**, and the people who write them are called **programmers**.

Today, you're going to become programmers. By the end of this class, you'll have written your very first computer program. Who's excited?

## What is Programming? (10 minutes)

**Teacher:** Let's start with a fundamental question: What is programming?

*[Write on board: "Programming = Giving instructions to a computer"]*

**Teacher:** Programming is essentially giving very specific, step-by-step instructions to a computer. But here's the catch - computers are incredibly literal. They do exactly what you tell them to do, nothing more, nothing less.

Let me give you an example. If I asked you to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, you'd probably figure it out, right? But if I asked a computer to do the same thing, I'd have to give instructions like:

1. Get two slices of bread
2. Open the peanut butter jar
3. Get a knife
4. Put the knife in the peanut butter
5. Scoop out one tablespoon of peanut butter
6. Spread it evenly on one slice of bread
7. Clean the knife...

*[Continue for a few more steps]*

**Teacher:** See how detailed that gets? That's programming! Now, let's talk about **Python**.

*[Write on board: "Python - A Programming Language"]*

**Teacher:** Python is one of many programming languages. Think of it like this - if you want to communicate with someone from France, you might learn French. If you want to communicate with a computer, you can learn Python.

Python is special because:
- It's beginner-friendly (reads almost like English)
- It's powerful (used by companies like Google, Netflix, Instagram)
- It's versatile (can build websites, analyze data, create games, control robots)

**Question for Class:** Can anyone think of what Instagram, YouTube recommendations, and Netflix suggestions have in common?

*[Wait for answers, guide toward "they're all built with Python"]*

## Setting Up Our Programming Environment (15 minutes)

**Teacher:** Now we need to set up our workspace. Today we'll use an online tool called Replit, which means we don't need to install anything on these computers.

*[Demonstrate on projector while students follow along]*

**Step-by-Step Setup:**

**Teacher:** Everyone open a web browser and go to **replit.com**

*[Wait for everyone to navigate there]*

**Teacher:** You'll see a "Create Repl" button. Click on that. 

*[Show on screen]*

**Teacher:** Now you'll see different programming languages. Find and click on "Python". 

**Teacher:** Give your project a name. Let's all call this first one "My_First_Program". Notice I used underscores instead of spaces - that's a programming convention we'll learn about later.

**Teacher:** Click "Create Repl" and wait for it to load.

*[Help students who are having trouble - walk around the room]*

**Teacher:** Perfect! Now you should see a screen with a few different sections:
- On the left: File explorer (shows your files)
- In the middle: Code editor (where we write our code)
- On the right: Console (where our program's output appears)

**Teacher:** Look at the middle section. You should see a file called "main.py" is already open. The ".py" tells us this is a Python file.

## Writing Our First Program (15 minutes)

**Teacher:** We're going to start with the most famous program in all of computer science. It's called "Hello, World!" and it's traditionally the first program every programmer writes.

*[Type on projector while students follow along]*

**Teacher:** In the code editor, type exactly what I type:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

**Teacher:** Now, let's run our program. See the green "Run" button at the top? Click it!

*[Wait for students to run their programs]*

**Teacher:** What happened? You should see "Hello, World!" appear in the console on the right. Congratulations - you just wrote your first computer program!

**Teacher:** Let's break down what we just did:
- `print()` is a **function** - it's a pre-built instruction that tells Python to display something
- The parentheses `()` are where we put what we want to display
- `"Hello, World!"` is a **string** - that's what we call text in programming
- The quotation marks tell Python "this is text, display it exactly as written"

**Teacher:** Now let's make it personal. Below your first line, add a new line:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
print("My name is [YOUR NAME]")
```

**Teacher:** Replace [YOUR NAME] with your actual name, keeping the quotation marks. For example, I would write:

```python
print("My name is Ms. Johnson")
```

**Teacher:** Run your program again. Now you should see both lines appear!

**Troubleshooting Moment:**
**Teacher:** If anyone got an error message, raise your hand. Common mistakes are:
- Forgetting quotation marks
- Misspelling "print"
- Using the wrong type of quotation marks

*[Help students debug their code]*

---

## Practice Activity: Digital Introduction (10 minutes)

**Teacher:** Now it's your turn to be creative! I want you to create a digital introduction using print statements. Your program should display:
1. A greeting
2. Your name
3. Your grade/age
4. One interesting fact about yourself
5. Your favorite subject

**Teacher:** Here's an example:

```python
print("Hey there!")
print("My name is Alex")
print("I'm in 9th grade")
print("I can juggle three tennis balls")
print("My favorite subject is art")
```

**Teacher:** You have 8 minutes to create your digital introduction. Remember:
- Each line needs `print()`
- Put your text in quotation marks
- You can be creative with your wording
- If you finish early, try adding more lines!

*[Circulate and help students, encourage creativity]*

**Teacher:** Time's up! Who would like to run their program and share their introduction with the class?

*[Have 3-4 volunteers share their programs]*

---

## Wrap-up and Looking Ahead (5 minutes)

**Teacher:** Outstanding work today! Let's recap what we learned:

*[Write on board as we review]*

1. **Programming** = giving step-by-step instructions to computers
2. **Python** = a beginner-friendly programming language
3. **print()** = a function that displays text
4. **Strings** = text enclosed in quotation marks

**Teacher:** For homework, I want you to expand your digital introduction program. Add three more print statements about yourself. Maybe include:
- Your favorite food
- A hobby you enjoy
- What you want to learn in this class
- Something that makes you unique

**Teacher:** Next class, we'll learn about **variables** - a way to store information in our programs, kind of like giving names to boxes where we keep our data.

**Teacher:** Before you leave, save your work by clicking "Save" or using Ctrl+S (Cmd+S on Mac). Your Replit account will keep all your programs so you can access them from any computer.

**Teacher:** Any questions about today's lesson?

*[Address any final questions]*

**Teacher:** Excellent! You're officially programmers now. See you next class!

## Teacher Notes for Session 1

### **Common Student Questions & Answers:**
- **"What if I make a mistake?"** That's totally normal! Programming is all about making mistakes and fixing them. We call this "debugging."
- **"Why do we need quotation marks?"** They tell Python "this is text to display" vs "this is a command to follow."
- **"Can I use single quotes instead of double quotes?"** Yes! In Python, both work the same way.

### **Extension Activities for Fast Finishers:**
- Try making ASCII art with print statements
- Create a program that tells a joke (setup on one line, punchline on another)
- Make a program that prints your schedule for today

### **Assessment Checkpoints:**
- [ ] Student successfully navigated to Replit
- [ ] Student created and ran "Hello, World!" program
- [ ] Student can explain what print() does
- [ ] Student created personalized introduction program
- [ ] Student demonstrates basic troubleshooting skills

### **Preparation for Next Session:**
- Ensure all students have saved their work and can access their Replit accounts
- Review variable concepts
- Prepare examples showing the difference between strings and numbers
- Have backup login information for students who forget their accounts

### **Differentiation Strategies:**
- **For struggling students:** Pair with a buddy, provide step-by-step written instructions
